}V. DharPublished 2013Computer SciencePhilosophy of Science eJournalThe use of the term 'Data Science' is becoming increasingly common along with 'Big Data.' What does Data Science mean? Is there something unique about it? What skills should a 'data scientist' possess to be productive in the emerging digital age characterized by a deluge of data? What are the implications for business and for scientific inquiry? In this brief monograph I address these questions from a predictive modeling perspective. View on ACMarchive.nyu.eduSave to LibraryCreate AlertCiteLaunch Research FeedShare This PaperTop 3 of 467 CitationsView AllEditorial - Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics: The Opportunity and Challenge for IS ResearchR.
